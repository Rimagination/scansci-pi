# Academic General - Design Specification

> Neutral general-purpose academic shells for research talks, course reports,
> progress reviews, paper explainers, scholarly exchanges, and thesis-adjacent
> summaries when no narrower scenario template is selected.

## I. Template Overview

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
| Template Name | `academic_general` |
| Category | General academic base |
| Use Cases | General academic presentations, research progress reports, course reports, paper explainers, thesis-adjacent summaries, scholarly exchange |
| Design Tone | Professional, rigorous, research-oriented, audience-facing, clear hierarchy |
| Theme Mode | Light theme with white background and dark-blue title bar |

## I-A. Academic Orchestration Contract

Read `references/academic-orchestration.md` before planning with this template.
`academic_general` follows a human-centered academic contract:

- Start with **Audience-State-Transfer**: identify the audience, initial state,
  desired state, core tension, and slide-by-slide transfer path.
- Use **SCQA** as the default academic spine: Situation, Complication,
  Question, Answer. Treat it as a story path, not as visible section labels.
- Each content page should create one audience-state shift and carry one
  defensible claim supported by source-linked evidence or clear reasoning.
- Visible slide text is audience-facing. Avoid developer-facing language such
  as template, slot, placeholder, executor, renderer, generation, pipeline, or
  implementation unless the talk is explicitly about software development.

## IX. SVG Technical Constraints

Mandatory rules:

1. viewBox: `0 0 1280 720`.
2. Use `<rect>` elements for backgrounds.
3. Use `<tspan>` for text wrapping; do not use `<foreignObject>`.
4. Use `fill-opacity` / `stroke-opacity` for transparency; do not use `rgba()`.
5. Prohibited: `mask`, `<style>`, `class`, `textPath`, `animate*`, and `script`.
6. `clipPath` is allowed only on `<image>` under `shared-standards.md` section 1.2.
7. `marker-start` / `marker-end` are conditionally allowed when marker shapes follow `shared-standards.md` section 1.1.

PPT compatibility:

- Do not use group opacity; set opacity on each child element individually.
- Use overlay layers for image transparency.
- Use inline styles only; do not use external CSS or `@font-face`.

## X. Placeholder Specification

Templates use `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` format placeholders. These are production
anchors, not visible slide copy.

| Placeholder | Description |
|---|---|
| `{{TITLE}}` | Main title |
| `{{SUBTITLE}}` | Subtitle |
| `{{AUTHOR}}` | Presenter name |
| `{{ADVISOR}}` | Optional advisor or mentor |
| `{{INSTITUTION}}` | University, lab, organization, or affiliation |
| `{{DATE}}` | Presentation date |
| `{{PAGE_TITLE}}` | Short running title |
| `{{SECTION_NUM}}` | Section number |
| `{{CHAPTER_NUM}}` | Chapter number |
| `{{CHAPTER_TITLE}}` | Chapter title |
| `{{CHAPTER_DESC}}` | Chapter description |
| `{{KEY_MESSAGE}}` | Conclusion or audience-state shift |
| `{{PAGE_NUM}}` | Page number |
| `{{SOURCE}}` | Data or source note |
| `{{SECTION_NAME}}` | Section name in footer |
| `{{TOC_ITEM_N_TITLE}}` | TOC item title |
| `{{TOC_ITEM_N_DESC}}` | TOC item description |
| `{{THANK_YOU}}` | Closing message |
| `{{ENDING_SUBTITLE}}` | Closing subtitle or takeaway |
| `{{CONTACT_INFO}}` | Contact information |
| `{{EMAIL}}` | Email address |
| `{{COPYRIGHT}}` | Copyright or source note |
| `{{LOGO}}` | Logo image or text fallback |

---

## XI. Human-Facing Composition Rules

1. Write for the audience's next judgment, not for the production process.
2. Use conclusion-style page titles; avoid vague labels such as "Background"
   unless paired with a clear claim.
3. Keep one main idea per slide. If a slide contains two state shifts, split it.
4. Prefer source-faithful figures, tables, and captions for academic evidence.
5. Use decorative tags and arrows only when they clarify the argument path.

---

## XII. Template Boundaries

- `academic_general` is the neutral academic fallback. Prefer a narrower template
  such as `literature_minimal`, `defense_leftnav`, or `defense_topnav` when the
  user explicitly selects that scenario.
- The visual shell provides hierarchy and rhythm; the academic scenario and
  source material define the argument.
- For mature source materials, preserve source claims, figures, tables,
  captions, and citations. Add external material only when requested.
